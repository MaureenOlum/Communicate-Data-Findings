# Communicate Data Findings
**Dataset Overview**
The Ford GoBike System dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in 2019.

In the data exploration, I explored individual bike rides taken from Ford Gobike bike-sharing system in San Francisco Bay Area, California in 2019. The main focus was which hour(s) of the day, which day(s) of the week and month(s) of the year were most trips taken and features that can best predict average bike trip like duration, age, gender and user type.
